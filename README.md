In this work I will present the implementation of the models proposed in [Temporal Attention Augmented Bilinear Network for Financial Time Series Data Analysis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8476227&casa_token=ku1x8IhINb8AAAAA:FOCQwqaSbL8u5Cc9RbzessVNuFDyoTQE4IFToKVM4dI1LLW9w9TD80eaCev66PXQa1kU92q30w&tag=1). 

In particular I've implented B(TABL) and C(TABL) using pytorch.

I reached the same metrics of the original paper.
